Capstone Project Proposal

1.  March Madness

	Using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2016/data, 
I wish to complete the corresponding challenge.  I must use this data to predict the probabilities 
of each outcome of every possible matchup from the NCAA tournaments from the last 5 years as well as this year.  
I wish to see how well the data can predict these outcomes.  I also think this will be interesting because 
this year has been so full of upsets already.  I would like to see if the data supports these.  
I may be able to come up with some reliable features that can help predict which games are most likely to end in an upset.

2.  Yelp Data Challenge

	By using the data available at https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset, 
I wish to explore natural language processing.  The end goal would be to predict the rating 
associated with a review from the text alone.  I think by determining which words were associated 
with positive and negative reviews I could come up with a model that attempts to predict the number 
given with reviews.

3.  College Scorecards

	I wish to use the data contained here https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/ in order to predict 
how much money a college spends on advertising.  I would also like to see the correlation between the 
student's family income and how much debt they leave with.  In particular, I am interested to see if 
for profit universities specifically target those who are less well off financially.  I am also interested 
in determining if all for profit institutions perform poorly when it comes to debt and expected levels of income, 
or if some actually do better than non profit institutions.
